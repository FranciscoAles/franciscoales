## What's up guys, I've got this website here to share a bit about my self/projects. ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this cool AI website drawlife.vercel.app, where you can draw stuff and Google Gemini will bring it to life.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Manim, a python library for animating math, and will hopefully use it to make some cool videos in the future.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: falesandroni@gmail.com.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy tree climbing.
